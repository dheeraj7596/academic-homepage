I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at the [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) working with [Prof. Jingbo Shang](https://shangjingbo1226.github.io/). I am broadly interested in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 

For summer 2022, I am interning at Microsoft Semantic Machines with [Dr. Subhro Roy](https://sroy9.github.io/) working on Weakly Supervised Semantic Parsing. I completed my Bachelor Of Technology in Computer Science And Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in/) in 2017, where I worked with [Prof. Harish Karnick](http://iitk.ac.in/new/dr-harish-karnick) and [Prof. Purushottam Kar](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/purushot/). I worked as a Data Scientist and Product Engineer at [Sprinklr](https://www.sprinklr.com/) for 2 years and I interned at [Microsoft India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in) in the summer of 2016.

### Current Research
**Few Shot & Weakly Supervised Learning** I develop high performing deep neural frameworks with minimal human supervision such as just [class labels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12794.pdf) or a few label-indicative [seed words](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.30.pdf). I am interested in leveraging massive amounts of [unstructured](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.670.pdf) and [unlabeled data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.08723.pdf) available on the internet for supervision and additional contextual information. Further, I am also keen on beneficially leveraging pre-trained language models to reduce the need for annotated data.

**Security** I study vulnerabilities of current NLP systems such as data poisoning and trigger-based backdoor attacks and work towards developing strong defense methods against such attacks.

**Deep Learning** A deep neural network is known to learn/overfit any randomly labeled data. I am interested in understanding and unveiling the learning process of deep neural architectures and further use it to analyze the quality of data. 

Apart from Academics, I enjoy spending time playing Ukulele, playing Football(soccer) and I rarely write too. Checkout my [blog](https://articulationofmyheart.wordpress.com/)!
