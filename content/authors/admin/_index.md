I am a Masterâ€™s student in the Computer Science department at University of California, San Diego working with Prof. Jingbo Shang. I completed my Bachelor Of Technology in Computer Science And Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 2017. I am broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, Text mining and Graph mining. My current research revolves around developing principled data-driven approaches with light human effort. I worked as a Data Scientist and Product Engineer at Sprinklr for 2 years and I interned at Microsoft India in the summer of 2016.

Apart from Academics, I enjoy spending time playing Lawn Tennis, Table Tennis, Badminton. I watch football(soccer) and I rarely write too. Checkout my [blog](https://articulationofmyheart.wordpress.com/)!
